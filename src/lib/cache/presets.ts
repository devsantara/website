   * Prevents the response from being stored in any cache — browser or CDN.

   * must never be persisted anywhere (e.g. authentication tokens, payment info,
   * one-time secrets, or any endpoint whose caching would constitute a security
   * risk).
   *
   * **Why:** `no-store` is the strongest prohibition. Unlike `no-cache` (which
   * still allows conditional storage), `no-store` instructs every intermediary
   * to discard the response immediately after delivery. No `cloudflare` override
   * is set because CDN-level storage of these responses is always wrong.
   *
   * @example
   * CachePreset.noStore()

   * benefit from conditional requests (304 Not Modified), but serving a stale
   * copy silently is not acceptable (e.g. dashboard summaries, live pricing,
   * inventory levels).
   *
   * **Why:** `no-cache` does not mean "do not cache" — it means "always check
   * freshness". Browsers can still store the response and avoid re-downloading
   * the body when the origin returns 304, saving bandwidth while guaranteeing
   * up-to-date content. No `cloudflare` override is set; CDN revalidation on
   * every request negates the benefit of a CDN.

   * CachePreset.noCache()

   * where browser caching speeds up navigation but CDN caching would serve one
   * user's data to another.
   *
   * **Why:** `private` restricts storage to the user's own browser cache.
   * `max-age=300` (5 min) lets the browser reuse the response across quick
   * navigation. `stale-while-revalidate=60` allows an immediate render of the
   * stale copy while a fresh fetch runs in the background, keeping the UX snappy
   * without sacrificing freshness. No `cloudflare` key is set deliberately —
   * Cloudflare must not store private responses.

   * You want CDN to absorb traffic spikes while keeping displayed data reasonably
   * fresh.
   *
   * **Why:** Browsers get a 60 s window (`max-age=60`) before considering the
   * response stale, with a 30 s revalidation grace (`stale-while-revalidate=30`)
   * for seamless background refreshes. Cloudflare's `s-maxage=300` lets the CDN
   * serve the same edge-cached copy for 5 min, absorbing origin load during
   * spikes, while a 60 s SWR grace on the CDN side means edge nodes revalidate
   * silently without interrupting users.

   * @example

  /**

   * default for any server-rendered page that does not contain personalized data.
   *
   * **Why:** Browsers treat responses as fresh for 5 min (`max-age=300`), with a
   * 60 s SWR window for background revalidation so users never see a loading
   * state between navigation. Cloudflare caches for 1 hour (`s-maxage=3600`)
   * with a 5 min SWR grace, dramatically reducing origin hits from repeated
   * visitors and crawlers while still picking up deploys within minutes.
   *
   * @example
   * CachePreset.standard()

   * you can tolerate up to an hour of stale content in browsers and up to a week
   * in CDN after a publish.
   *
   * **Why:** A 24 h browser TTL (`max-age=86400`) eliminates redundant requests
   * for returning visitors in the same day, with a 1 h SWR grace to handle the
   * transition silently. Cloudflare stores for 7 days (`s-maxage=604800`),
   * keeping origin load near zero for stable content, while a 1 day SWR on the
   * CDN ensures deploys propagate gradually without a hard cache break.
   *

   * // Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=3600

  /**
   * Permanent caching for content-hashed static assets.

   * images). Never use this for URLs that can serve different content over time.
   *
   * **Why:** `max-age=31536000` (1 year) is the de-facto browser maximum for
   * permanent caching. The `immutable` directive tells the browser the file will
   * never change during its freshness lifetime, suppressing conditional
   * revalidation requests on back/forward navigation. Cloudflare mirrors the same
   * policy at the edge. Because the URL itself changes on every build, cache
   * busting is handled automatically — no manual purge is needed.
   *
   * @example
   * CachePreset.immutable()
   * // Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
   * // CDN-Cache-Control: s-maxage=31536000, immutable
